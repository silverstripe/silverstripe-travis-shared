# These jobs used to have an ascending REQUIRE_INSTALLER 4.7.x-dev, 4.8.x-dev, 4.9.x-dev, 4.x-dev
# Because phpunit9 requires framework ^4.10 (unreleased), the minimum compatible recipe is now 4.x-dev
# 4.10.x-dev should be added to the first job when that branch has been created
# 4.11.x-dev and subsequent versions should be added as branches for those are also created
